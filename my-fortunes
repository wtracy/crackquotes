Stupid birds, rising up to take control of the planet. I always knew they were up to no good with their beady little eyes. Fine, sure, we left the surface alone and moved underground or whatever because even our SPF 99^9 wasn't cutting it. Doesn't mean the planet doesn't still belong to us, birds. We'll show you though. We have guns that fire bees. Angry, angry bees. They'll sting you and maybe also make honey, although that last part isn't really relevant here. BEES.

Note that placing GAS in 16-bit mode does not mean that the resulting code will necessarily run on a 16-bit pre-80386 processor. At the moment this would be rather difficult, because GAS currently supports only 32-bit addressing modes. So you can write code that runs on 16-bit processors, but only if that code never references memory.

The use of this redundant [little-endian and big-endian] coding was necessary to avoid huring anyone's feelings when the [ISO 9660] standard was developed. If the standard had dictated little endian, then people from companies whose products were big endian would have felt like second-class citizens and would not have accepted the standard. The emotional content of a CD-ROM can thus be quantified and measured exactly in kilobytes/hour of wasted space.
    -- Andrew Tanenbaum, _Modern Operating Systems_
%
[ISO 9660] Years begin to count at 1900, which means that CD-ROMs will suffer from a Y2156 problem because the year following 2155 will be 1900. This problem could have been delayed by defining the origin time to be 1988 (the year the standard was adopted). Had that been done, the problem would have been postponed until 2244.
